# Rover
## About
Rover is a small and very experimental AI written fully in C. The goal is to start with basic AI-related functions, and to end with a smart AI that is written in the purest and fastest programming language.
## Requirements
The requirements to get Rover up & running on your machine, are just a C compiler, and a program that can execute Makefiles, such as GNU Make or BSD Make.
## Building
Execute the Makefile using `make`:
```sh
make
```
This will build all `.c` files inside the `source` directory, and output a single binary named `rover`.
You can execute Rover by executing the `rover` binary:
```sh
./rover
```
